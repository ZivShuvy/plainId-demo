# plainId-demo
A subset of the PlainID Demo App created as a part of job interview assignment.

## TECH STACK
This app was created with React.js and designed with SASS.

## SUMMARY
In order to simulate a real server and DB, all the queries functions to the data file are asynchronously. In addition, I used debounce search input and created a local-storage cache mechanism to the actions db.
I divided my code into components to make it clear and efficient using the power of reusable components.
To build the layouts in the app I mainly used Flexbox.
The app is responsive and looks nice in all screen-sizes.
